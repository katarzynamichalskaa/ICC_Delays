# ICC_Delays
This project focuses on analyzing delays in PKP Intercity (PKP ICC) trains with the ultimate goal of building a predictive model. By gathering historical delay data, we aim to gain insights into patterns, factors, and trends influencing train delays within the PKP ICC network. The project involves data collection from HTML files containing historical delay information, data preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model for predicting future train delays.

## Key Objectives:

Data Collection: Gather historical delay data from PKP ICC trains.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze patterns and trends in the delay data to understand contributing factors.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features for training the predictive model.
Model Development: Build a machine learning model to predict train delays based on historical data.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance and refine as needed.
